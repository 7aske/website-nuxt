      Hi, my name is Nikola. I’m a
      nerd and an aspiring software
      engineer specializing in the
      development of web systems.
      Among the wide spectrum of my
      interests, I would emphasize
      backend web development, devops, Linux systems and clean
      reusable architectures. I base
      my knowledge off of late Richard
      Feynman’s quote &quot;What I cannot
      create, I do not understand.&quot;
      which can be observed on my
      github/website. Also, Robert C.
      Martin had an enormous influence
      on me with his book Clean Code
      which felt eye-opening and
      relatable on numerous levels. I
      think I am honest, enthusiastic,
      easy to work with, more than
      eager to learn more and also
      willing to think outside the box
      to solve any problem. Also, I am
      a big advocate for open-source
      software. Besides programming,
      I’m interested in space
      exploration and documentary
      photography.
